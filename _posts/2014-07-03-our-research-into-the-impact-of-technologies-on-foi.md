title: Our research into the impact of technologies on FOI
wordpress_id: 455
---
In March this year mySociety put out [a call for a research consultant](https://www.mysociety.org/2014/03/31/seeking-a-research-contractor-with-transparency-and-accountability-expertise/) to look at the place that  Alaveteli - mySociety's open source freedom of information (FOI) filer -  might have in creating cultures of transparency and accountability.  So, eventually, mySociety chose us - Savita Bailur and Tom Longley. Since we're the strangers here, we'd like to introduce ourselves, give you an idea of the approach that we'll be taking, and what we've found in the first weeks of the research.

##Who are we?

Savita is a consultant who has previously worked for the World Bank, Commonwealth Secretariat, USAID, and Panos and taught at the University of Manchester and London School of Economics. She has a personal interest in freedom of information as her family in India successfully used the Right to Information Act in India to find out about violations of building regulations (although the legal process to change things is taking more time). If there's one thing of Savita's to read, it's [Closing the Feedback Loop : Can Technology Bridge the Accountability Gap?](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/18408), which she wrote in and co-edited.

Tom is a human rights and technology consultant who's worked on field investigations of crimes against humanity. After years wading through stacks of documentation and interview transcripts, he became interested in how data and technologies could help this work. He has since worked for investigation organisations in Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Zimbabwe and others helping building up their ability to use data and technologies safely and effectively. Tom also consults for Tactical Technology Collective, Global Witness and Open Society Foundations. If there's one thing of his to read, it's probably ["Deadly Environment"](http://globalwitness.org/deadlyenvironment), a report about murders of environmental defenders.

##What are we doing?

The top level question we're addressing is: "In what circumstances, if any, can tools like Alaveteli be shown to have measurable impacts on the ability of citizens to exert power over underperforming institutions?" To get at this, we'll be doing three things:

* First, a review of the studies so far on the impact of the internet on FOI. Our early findings flag a lot of research into the mechanics of FOI, but very little on its impact, other than anecdotal evidence. There are some great points and questions raised in the literature however, which we combine into roughly ten areas of impact. These include FOI's role in aiding the transition from transparency to accountability, the role of different groups (like the media, movements, non-governmental and community groups), public and institutional perceptions, security and privacy. We find that the overall challenge is that the technology is only part of the FOI value chain - governments also need to respond, and sanctions/enforcements put in place which ensure governments are transparent and accountable.

* Second, a field scan of practitioners. There are nearly 20 FOI websites running Alaveteli. Some sites are just getting started, like [Доступ До Правди ("Access the Truth")](https://dostup.pravda.com.ua/list/all) in Ukraine. By talking with the people setting up and using these sites, we aim to pull together a view of what makes a successful implementation, what the challenges are, and what can be learned for future implementors of FOI sites.

* Third, a list of critical success factors, pulled together from both the literature and practitioner reviews, which will be translated into major languages.

All these documents should be published this September, along with something brief and readable with the topline findings.


##What are we asking of you?

If you run an Alaveteli site, we may have already emailed you or will do very soon asking if you can spare some time to talk with us as part of the practioner review.  More generally, we're continuing to look for more articles and 'grey' literature, in particular any quantitative studies, about the role of technologies in FOI. We have a shorter list of articles we have found so far [here](#short-reference-list), and a longer list [here](#long-reference-list) - have we missed any? Please let us know.

To wrap up, this is first generation research into this area.  We hope to have material that can be useful to you and mySociety. Any questions, get in touch via the comments field, or via twitter at any of our handles ([@alaveteli_foi](https://twitter.com/alaveteli_foi), [@tlongers](https://twitter.com/tlongers), [@savitabailur](https://twitter.com/savitabailur)).
