We've just released [Alaveteli 0.19](https://github.com/mysociety/alaveteli/tree/0.19)!

## The highlights

This release we've been working on making Alaveteli easier to [install]({{ site.baseurl }}docs/installing/).

* We've overhauled the [manual install guide]({{ site.baseurl }}docs/installing/manual_install/) to be much more comprehensive.
* The [email setup guide]({{ site.baseurl }}docs/installing/email/) has updated instructions for Exim and Postfix, and adds some extra troubleshooting tips.
* We've improved the [generators](https://github.com/mysociety/alaveteli/blob/0.19/lib/tasks/config_files.rake) for some of the config files and added [more](https://github.com/mysociety/alaveteli/blob/0.19/config/nginx.conf.example) – and [better](https://github.com/mysociety/alaveteli/blob/0.19/config/httpd.conf-example) – examples for ones we can't generate yet.
* Developers can now pick one of the [supported operating systems](https://github.com/mysociety/alaveteli/blob/0.19/Vagrantfile#L63) to use for their Vagrant VM.

We've also made some great improvements to the framework.

* Added responsive stylesheets! We've made this the default, but you can configure whether they're used or not in `config/general.yml`.
* Support for the Portuguese locale.
* Improved search term highlighting.
* The Public Body Stats page can now be made available to your users.
* Added a Rake task for cleaning up holding pen events (`rake cleanup:holding_pen`).
* Added searching of bodies by their short name.

You can see the full list of highlights and upgrade notes in the [changelog](https://github.com/mysociety/alaveteli/blob/rails-3-develop/doc/CHANGES.md).

Thanks to everyone who's [contributed](https://github.com/mysociety/alaveteli/graphs/contributors)!
