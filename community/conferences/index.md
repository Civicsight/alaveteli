On 19 and 20 May 2015, we hosted the <a

international AlaveteliCon</a> in Madrid with our partner organisation
<a href="http://www.access-info.org/">Access Info Europe</a>.

AlaveteliCon is the world&rsquo;s only conference on Freedom of
Information technologies and brought together 60 participants
from across the world who all have one thing in common: an interest
in online Right To Know tools.
